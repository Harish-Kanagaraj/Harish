        <h1>About Royal Backery</h1>
        <p>First just a little bite about Royal Bakery. We are located in the beautiful town of Quincy California. Royal Bakery opened in 2013 with a goal to create delicious custom baked goods. Our passion is to provide the most flavor-filled, baked from scratch products for our friends in Plumas County. We are a BY APPOINTMENT only bakery. Our bakery is NOT a retail location. Please use the contact form to make an appointment or place an order. We aim for perfection, safety, and delicious in all that we create.</p>
        <h2>Royal Backery kitchen</h2>
        <p>Everything on the menu is made and baked in our fully certified home kitchen. This is made possible under the California Cottage Food Act. Our kitchen is custom designed to bake for you! Over the years we have aquired the tools necessary to bake for larger events.
