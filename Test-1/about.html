    <h2>Our Bakery all about</h2>
    <p>
        A bakery can be established as a retail business from a storefront location selling baked goods to consumers, or a bakery can be established as a wholesale business selling baked goods to food retailers and institutions. Additionally, many bakeries will operate both as a retail and wholesale business to increase the size of their potential market as well as revenues and profits. Establishing a bakery is a very straightforward process with one exception--the best bakers possess bakers trade papers--so be prepared to hire a qualified baker, or take the time necessary to become one. The profit potential is good for a bakery, especially if the business focuses on both retail and wholesales baked goods sales.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>A bakery is an establishment that produces and sells flour-based food baked in an oven such as bread, cookies, cakes, doughnuts, bagels, pastries, and pies.[1] Some retail bakeries are also categorized as caf√©s, serving coffee and tea to customers who wish to consume the baked goods on the premises. Confectionery items are also made in most bakeries throughout the world.</p>
